## Reason for imcomplete project
Our team worked very hard on this project however we as a group did not have the necessary skills to implement a database into our site and 
utilize an AI off of that data. Had we had formal education in these topics we are confident we couldve created a well put together
car buying site. No one in our team had usable experience in utilizing a database for a website nor in training and utilizing an AI.
We all attempted to learn how to do both of these tasks but we were unable to figure it out as a group. In terms of the sections we were 
capable of doing we worked extremely hard and we all learned alot.
